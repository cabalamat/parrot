6-Aug-1999: PH started coding Parrot project.

21-Aug-1999: adding menu components to Html backend.
The code is currently about 1550 lines.

23-Aug-1999: released parrot-0.0.1

24-Aug-1999: added getAttrDoc() to backend classes.

28-Aug-1999: added makbacl.py, got Paxo backend working

4-Sep-1999: tidied up, released parrot-0.1.0

4-Sep-1999: working on PytkBackend (for Python/Tkinter)

5-Sep-1999: Got PytkBackend working with simple5.par (it
doesn't as yet work with other par files -- this one is
heavily doctored to make it work). Code approx. 2400 lines.
Releasing this as parrot-0.2.0 (increased 2nd level number
indicates new backend added)

7-Sep-1999: added checkBox, radioButton to Pytk backend.
Alter parser so @id, "text", attr=val can be in any order.

11-Sep-1999: Modified pparser.py so it accepts C++ style
comments. Also, improved error handling.
On pytkBackend, all id attributes are now optional, and 
are filled in by a sequential value if not defined.
Wrote table/tr/td classes for PytkBackend (1st version,
which won't work properly under all circumstances and is 
horrible code).

12-Sep-1999:
released parrot-0.2.1; code size approx 2580 lines.

14-Sep-1999: added generic attributes; code size 2650 lines.

24-Sep-1999: generic ``for'' seems to work. 
Internal release 0.2.2; code size 2660 lines.

11-Feb-2000: PytkBackend now creates callbacks for menu items
and checkboxes.

12-Feb-2000: added Html_textArea and Pytk_textArea classes.
These implement multi-line text entry fields.

12-Feb-2000: Internal release 0.2.3; code size 2760 lines.

12-Feb-2000: Upgraded to SPARK-0.5; wrote tokpos.py module
to work with this.
Internal release 0.2.4 is identical to 0.2.3 except for use
of SPARK-0.5; code size 2760 lines.

14-Jun-2001: after a long break, doing more work on Parrot.
Created internal release 0.2.5, prior to adding changes made
by Ludger Humbert (<humbert@ls12.cs.uni-dortmund.de>). In
the meantime, have added Makefile, for ``make clean''.

14-Jun-2001: adding Ludger Humbert's changes to PytkBackend.py
and HtmlBackend.py. 

There's a bug in his HtmlBackend.py which I'm fixing.... fixed!

14-Jun-2001: releasing 0.2.6 (for external release).
``wc *.py Makefile'' reports code size is 2809 lines.

14-Oct-2001: added Alex Schroeder's code for an Elisp backend.
Made some mods to his code, emailed them back to him. The 
Elisp backend isn't useable as yet, but is at present an 
interesting place to start.
